    I'm not sure what I'm doing at the moment.  

                                                                          The "project" is one way I define who 
I am and what kind of designer I want to be. I am using short term interests to collect tools and knowledge 
in order to help me in future projects. This loop will continue forever and I will grow up to become the culmination 
of the things I've made. 

As a designer I intend to continue exploring furniture design (as "furnisculpture" when possible) because I 
appreciate its place in our lives as art valued for both its function and beauty. Ive grown up with a rudimentary
wood shop in my garage that allowed me to start my projects at a young age, but only got into making furniture
as a creative outlet in early university. 

I will  continue to practice film making as a means of showing ideas as, especially now, video seems to be
the most effective method of digitally sharing the presence of objects. I think the faux ted talk I made for 
the last project made me realize how much more efficiently an idea can be conveyed through that medium. In the
past, both of these practices have served similar, but separate roles. Furniture and video are simply ways of 
creating pretty gestures, through wood, light, balance, and cuts. Short combination of design and video has
shown me that together they can bring story to design and form to video.   

As for what I want to do next, its time for me to give my engineering side a revisit. For all of high school and the
two years of school after that I thought I wanted to be a robotics engineer, but the amount of coding ultimately
boggled me back to the world of art. I got more from robotics competitions than I did from two years of studying
robotics, in which I learned the messy fundamentals of robot/human interaction, something I want to explore again
with fresh eyes. What I once viewed as wasted time, has become the basis for my design future. I believe that this
time has given me an interesting perspective into the future of technology, and with my newish focus on design
I want to explore the cross section of the two. Alone, neither will solve the problems challenging humanity both 
globally and locally, but together I think I might be able to define the problems. 

Other than that I would like to try designing in a more formal context. Im not sure if  I will enjoy designing for 
a company or client, but I am excited to try it in the next term. It might be a powerful position to be in, having
a professional outlet for my ideas on sustainability and change, which is the dream for everyone, especially designers.
