<c1>NOV 20
    <br>LOCATION: BRADFORDONAVON</br>
I am starting this blog in order to document the process of an upcoming project. In its current state, the project is no more than a few vague questions and an upcoming monthly filmmakers meetup. Why now? I've just been declined funding for a research/design fellowship that I knew was out of my league. On paper I had most of the qualifications and I think I could have done a good job of it, but I feel as though I was still too inexperienced for the role. The fellowship was for a media company and local design studio looking into the future of radio and audio technology. In the copious preparation for my application and later interview, I developed the framework of a process that I've unknowingly developped over my life of making things. It will be this framework that I will use to guide my project. While the last two weeks of fellowship prep might have amounted to failure, I feel positive knowing that lessons have been learned and I wont have to give myself over to a soulless media company for the next 10 months.
