        **the website**
	as art
	-early noughties cyber fetishism
the internet is monopolized by the big sites, no longer has the magic of exploration
handmade sites, similar to handmade jewelry, or local businesses 

the digital avatar as part of the site
	we have come to think in tabs, computational thinking
	a representation of how we think now trained by computers
I dont like good design
-"good design" is a product of what sells
-minimalism flourished because it was easy to produce

I want to be an auteur and a purveyor of fine forms

***film following character inundated by pessimistic media*** 


**video essay** 
	on tools 
		sacred tools, digital tools arent sacred because they are unlimited, computers are no longer a tool because their agency is evident
unlimited! youve got millions of playlist to listen to
	on convenience
	on novelty
