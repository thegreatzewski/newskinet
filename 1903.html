        <b>______________________________i dont like "good design"
            "good design" exists as a product of capitalism
            and design shouldnt exist to make money

                        we've been duped into loving minimalism 
                                because its easy to manufacture?
            
 1           
                            i want to be an auteur designer
                                a maker
                           because i want to explore forms
                           
    we dont need anymore items, the traditional designer is no longer needed
     so in order to explore, I must create on the small scale, 
                                              site specific

                                              I am interested in a different kind of design, 
                                                 design as a practice, rather than an industry 
                                              Im not overly concerned with speed, practicality, economy, or reach, 
                                                   concerns such as those are killing animals and melting ice


                                                   and I dont think design alone can fix those problems, and im not entirely sure "design" is that important in the grand scheme of things. I love "designing" far too much to be the judge of its value, so maybe i will just continue practicing it. 
                                        
                                                  
                                                  
                                                   *subject to change with my financial status, sadly
                           
                           
                           








            i also want to be a cowboy
