    <b>Hello, you've scanned the robot fighting league qr code

 I am starting a robot combat league here at CSM and need participants and help organizing. No prior experience required
We will have a first meeting at the end of the week of October 18th 2021

The UK fighting robotics competition is broken up into several different weight classes, we could potentially follow
 these or we could create our own set of rules.
    
 The benefits of following the set rules are that we could then go on to compete in real competitions and we 
 can use the existing resources to help us with our robots. There is actually a pretty full calender of events 
 here: <a href= "https://bristolbotbuilders.com/calendar.html" >calender</a>

    On the other hand it would probably be more fun just to do what ever we want and compete within ourselves. 
    Depending on how many people are interested we can make this decision at our next meeting. 


The different weight classes are : ANT WEIGHT (150G, 4"X4"), BEETLE WEIGHT(1.5 KG), FEATHERWEIGHT(13.6 KG), HEAVY WEIGHT (THE KIND YOU WOULD SEE ON TV) 
        I think our best bet would either be <a href ="https://bristolbotbuilders.com/guides.html#ant">ANT</a> or <a href ="https://bristolbotbuilders.com/guides.html#beetle">BEETLE</a> weight as every starts getting more expensive as we go up.
        Their <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bristolbotbuilders">facebook</a> group has a bunch of good examples of those

  They tend to run on rc car/drone style ESCs/servos/motors (all available through their shop) which are far 
   faster and more powerful than anything you could run off of an arduino, though we could 
    still build our robots around an arduino if we wanted. Arduino would be cheaper and slightly easier, 
    and would have a lot more scope as far as creativity goes.

    This is just the first bit of research that I've done, what we do doesnt have to look anything like this. We could race robots, we could
    make one big robot, we could make a ton of little robots, we could hot glue wires together and call it a robot, that is all up to
    you guys and the dicussions we have in our meetings.
