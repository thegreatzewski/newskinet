             Made from a reclaimed disco light, Obe was given a second life as the focus of my Creative Futures Residency in Bristol. <br><br>
Installed in the middle of a large room, I programmed the robot to be an interactive and non-human character welcoming of conversation. Being a disco light, OBe has only two axis of movement and an rgb light to express itself. By also giving it the means to see (hidden webcam) and listen (an exageratedly floppy microphone), I wanted to explore the alternative forms of communication possible with movement and light. Being a visually friendly object, people were immediately attached to it and spent hours trying to learn its gestural language.
